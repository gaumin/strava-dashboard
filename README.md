# strava-dashboard
A simple dashboard of sport activities logged on Strava app using Pandas and Ploty Express. 

NOTE: Github does not support rich view of Jupyter notebooks, therefore charts of ploty aren't displayed here. You can see this plots on my kaggle notebook:

Ploty Express support interactive charts, so it's a great option for. Here is some examples of charts by Ploty Express:

![Distance by Year ](https://github.com/gaumin/strava-dashboard/blob/main/images/1-distance-by-year.jpg "Total distance by Year")


![Distance by Month and Year ](https://github.com/gaumin/strava-dashboard/blob/main/images/2-distance-by-monh.jpg) "Total distance by Month and Year")
