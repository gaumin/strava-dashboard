# strava-dashboard
A simple dashboard of sport activities logged on Strava app using Pandas and Ploty Express. 

NOTE: Github does not support rich view of Jupyter notebooks, therefore charts of ploty aren't displayed here. You can see this plots on my kaggle notebook:

Ploty Express support interactive charts, so it's a great option for. Here is some examples of charts by Ploty Express:
