# Strava Dashboard
A simple dashboard of sport activities logged on Strava app using Pandas and Ploty Express. I built this dashboard to analyze my cycling activities, but it can be easily adapted to other type of sport activities by changing type of sport.

NOTE: Github does not support rich view of Jupyter notebooks, therefore charts of Ploty aren't displayed here. You can see this plots on my kaggle notebook:

Ploty Express supports interactive charts (zoom, pan, alt text, etc), so it's a great option for building such dashboards. 

Here are some examples of charts by Ploty Express:

![Distance by Month and Year](https://github.com/gaumin/strava-dashboard/blob/main/images/2-distance-by-monh.jpg)
